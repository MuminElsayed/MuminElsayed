- 👋 Hi, I’m @MuminElsayed
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Dev, Machine Learning, and VR.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PhotonEngine & Procedural Generation, and working as a freelance Unity game developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work as a developer (game or software), I'm also a business graduate so anything with ERP systems, logistics & supply chain, or marketing. A mix between business and development would be perfect! ^^
- 📫 Reach me on muminelsayed@gmail.com
- My Github is currently a WIP, I will be moving all my project scripts from the cloud to here.
- I have another portfolio about me here: https://muminhemayed.weebly.com/
- Happy coding!
