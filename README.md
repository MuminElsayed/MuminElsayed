- 👋 Hi, I’m @MuminElsayed, if you're here to check out my coding I made a quick summary here: https://github.com/MuminElsayed/Cool-Stuff-I-Made
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Dev & Business Management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PhotonEngine & Procedural Generation, and working as a freelance Unity game developer.
- 💞️ I’m a fresh business grad looking to work fulltime as a developer (game or software), or anything with ERP systems, logistics & supply chain, or marketing. A mix between business and development would be perfect! ^^
- 📫 Reach me on muminelsayed@gmail.com
- My Github is currently a WIP, I will be moving all my projects from the cloud to here over time.
- Happy coding!
